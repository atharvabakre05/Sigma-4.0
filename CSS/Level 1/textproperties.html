    <h1>Death Note</h1>

<hr/>
    <p>Death Note (stylized in all caps) is a Japanese manga series written by Tsugumi Ohba and illustrated by Takeshi Obata. 
        It was serialized in Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump from December 2003 to May 2006, with its 
        chapters collected in 12 tankōbon volumes. The story follows Light Yagami, a genius high school student who discovers
         a mysterious notebook: the "Death Note", which belonged to the shinigami Ryuk, and grants the user the supernatural 
         ability to kill anyone whose name is written in its pages. The series centers around Light's subsequent attempts to use 
         the Death Note to carry out a worldwide massacre of individuals whom he deems immoral and to create a crime-free society, 
         using the alias of a god-like vigilante named "Kira", and the subsequent efforts of an elite Japanese police task force, 
         led by enigmatic detective L, to apprehend him.</p>

    <h2>Cast</h2>
    &nbsp;
    <p>Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man:
        A self-described genius, billionaire, playboy, and philanthropist who wears an electromechanical suit of 
        armor of his own invention. Downey was cast as part of his four-picture deal with Marvel Studios, which 
        included Iron Man 2 (2010) and The Avengers.[12] He initially suggested to Whedon that Stark should be the 
        lead character, stating, "Well, I said, 'I need to be in the opening sequence. I don't know what you're 
        thinking, but Tony needs to drive this thing.' He was like, 'Okay, let's try that.' We tried it and it 
        didn't work, because this is a different sort of thing, the story and the idea and the theme is the theme,
         and everybody is just an arm of the octopus."[13] Downey commented on the character's evolution, stating, 
         "In Iron Man, which was an origin story, he was his own epiphany and redemption of sorts. Iron Man 2 is 
         all about not being an island, dealing with legacy issues and making space for others. . . In The Avengers, 
         he's throwing it down with the others". [14] Downey earned $50 million from the film, "once box-office 
         bonuses and backend compensation [were] factored in".[15]</p>
